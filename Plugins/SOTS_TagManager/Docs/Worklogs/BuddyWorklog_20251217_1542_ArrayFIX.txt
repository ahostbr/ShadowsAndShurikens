Those errors are coming from UHT parsing UPROPERTY fields it doesn’t support:

TMap<..., TMap<...>> is not a legal UPROPERTY value type.
FDelegateHandle is not a UPROPERTY‑compatible type, so UHT can’t reflect it.
I removed the UPROPERTY markers from those two internal maps so UHT stops parsing them. No runtime behavior change (they’re transient, internal caches).

Changes:

Plugins/SOTS_TagManager/Source/SOTS_TagManager/Public/SOTS_GameplayTagManagerSubsystem.h
Cleanup:

Plugins/SOTS_TagManager/Binaries, Plugins/SOTS_TagManager/Intermediate (already absent)
Tests not run.

Next steps:

Rebuild to confirm UHT gets past those errors.
If anything still complains about FDelegateHandle, I can add an explicit include for it, but removing UPROPERTY usually resolves it.
