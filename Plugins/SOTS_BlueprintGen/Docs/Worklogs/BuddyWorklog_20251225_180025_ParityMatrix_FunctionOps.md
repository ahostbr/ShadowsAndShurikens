# Buddy Worklog — 2025-12-25 18:00:25 — Parity matrix: manage_blueprint_function

## Goal
Update the VibeUE parity matrix to reflect that `manage_blueprint_function` actions are now implemented via `bp_function_*` bridge operations.

## What Changed
- Updated the `manage_blueprint_function` section to mark list/get/params/locals/delete as implemented.
- Noted `update_properties` remains partial (limited supported metadata).

## Files Changed
- `Plugins/SOTS_BlueprintGen/Docs/VibeUE_Upstream_ParityMatrix.md`

## Verification
UNVERIFIED
- Documentation-only change; no build/editor validation.
