goal
- Execute the bpgen_create_blueprint job and apply the BeginPlay notification graph with SOTS_ALLOW_APPLY=1 to verify /Game/BPGen/BP_BPGen_Testing plus the Merry Christmas Ryan! notification flow.

what changed
- Ran a one-off Python script that imports the MCP server, enables SOTS_ALLOW_APPLY/SOTS_ALLOW_BPGEN_APPLY, and invokes `bpgen_create_blueprint` followed by `bpgen_apply` with the documented graph spec.

files changed
- DevTools/python/logs/sots_mcp_server.jsonl (generated by the MCP helper during the scripted calls).

notes + risks/unknowns
- The bridge plugin responded that `create_blueprint_asset` is unknown, so the blueprint was not created.
- Applying the graph spec failed because the blueprint could not be loaded (the target asset does not exist).
- The new API additions in BPGen still need to be mirrored inside the SOTS_BPGen_Bridge plugin before mutations can succeed.

verification status
- UNVERIFIED (could not create or modify Blueprint because the bridge rejected the actions).

follow-ups / next steps
- Update SOTS_BPGen_Bridge to forward the `create_blueprint_asset` action (and any supporting data) to the Blueprint creation bridge helper.
- Re-run the job once the bridge understands the request and then replay the graph spec apply to confirm the notification pipeline.
