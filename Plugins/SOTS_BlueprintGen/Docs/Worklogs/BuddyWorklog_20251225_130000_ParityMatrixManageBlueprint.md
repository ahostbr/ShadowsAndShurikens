# Buddy Worklog — 2025-12-25 13:00 — Parity matrix update (manage_blueprint)

## Goal
Update the parity matrix to reflect completion of previously-stubbed `manage_blueprint` actions.

## What Changed
- Marked `get_info`, `get_property`, `set_property`, `reparent`, `list_custom_events`, `summarize_event_graph` as **Done** and documented their bridge action mappings.

## Files Changed
- Plugins/SOTS_BlueprintGen/Docs/VibeUE_Upstream_ParityMatrix.md

## Verification Status
UNVERIFIED
- Documentation-only change.

## Follow-ups / Next Steps
- After Ryan validates the new actions end-to-end, update any remaining notes if payload shapes differ from upstream prompts.
