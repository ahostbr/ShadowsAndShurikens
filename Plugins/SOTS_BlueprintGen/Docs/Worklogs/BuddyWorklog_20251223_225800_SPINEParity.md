# Buddy Worklog — SPINE Pass Confirmation

goal
- confirm SPINE passes A–E and collect the documented parity notes relative to the VibeUE pattern via the RAG workflow.

what changed
- refreshed the RAG index, ran a dedicated query for SPINE pass parity, and reviewed the SPINE_A through SPINE_E worklogs (discovery, spawner keys, schema linking, discovery-first flow, and inspection/NodeId handling) to ensure each pass is captured.

files changed
- Plugins/SOTS_BlueprintGen/Docs/Worklogs/BuddyWorklog_20251223_225800_SPINEParity.md

notes + risks/unknowns
- no code changes or editor runs were performed; confirmation is based solely on documentation.
- future verification will require running BPGen in-editor or via MCP flows to prove parity in practice.

verification status
- UNVERIFIED (documentation only)

follow-ups / next steps
- share the assembled SPINE pass summary with the team and determine if any passes need follow-on code/tests.
