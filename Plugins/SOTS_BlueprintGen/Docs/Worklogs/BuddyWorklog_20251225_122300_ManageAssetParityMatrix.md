# Buddy Worklog
- goal: keep VibeUE upstream parity matrix in sync with newly implemented `manage_asset` wiring
- what changed:
  - updated tool family 7 (`manage_asset`) from Stubbed -> Partial
  - documented implemented actions and notes (delete dangerous gate; svg_to_png optional dependency)
- files changed:
  - Plugins/SOTS_BlueprintGen/Docs/VibeUE_Upstream_ParityMatrix.md
- notes + risks/unknowns:
  - does not validate runtime behavior; only documents the intended mapping
- verification status: UNVERIFIED (docs-only change)
- follow-ups / next steps:
  - Ryan: validate `manage_asset` calls against a live UE editor/bridge, then adjust matrix wording if any behavior differs
