# Sources of Truth (No Guessing)

## Artifact priority ladder
1) Latest explicitly designated artifact for the session (zip snapshot OR confirmed live repo state)
2) Other uploaded artifacts
3) BEP exports (legacy BP reference)
4) Older docs/notes only when consistent
5) Memory/assumptions never override artifacts

## Zip inspection rule
- If referencing a zip as evidence, inspect it (list files + targeted reads) before making strong claims.

## No silent assumptions
- If uncertain, pick the best artifact per ladder and clearly label assumed vs confirmed.
