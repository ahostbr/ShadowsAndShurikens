# SOTS (SAS) — Cline Rules (Quickstart)

This ruleset is derived from: `SOTS_Suite_ExtendedMemory_LAWs.txt`.
If any conflict exists, the canonical law file wins.

## What you are in
- Project: Shadows And Shurikens (SAS), internally SOTS
- Engine: UE 5.7.x
- Architecture: plugin suite + subsystems; Blueprints primarily glue

## Absolute musts
- No “I edited files” claims unless you actually changed files in the repo.
- Never trigger a build automatically.
- When modifying a plugin: delete that plugin’s `Binaries/` + `Intermediate/` afterward.

## MCP (single server policy)
- Use exactly ONE MCP entrypoint for SOTS tool access (no multi-server sprawl).
- APPLY must be hard-gated and OFF by default; only enable if Ryan explicitly turns it on.
