# SOTS Non-Negotiables (Do Not Break)

## 1) Output discipline (token guard)
- Do NOT paste full files or giant diffs in chat.
- Prefer: short worklog bullets + list of files touched + next actions.
- Only show patches/diffs if explicitly asked.

## 2) Minimal diffs
- Use minimal, surgical edits.
- Avoid formatting-only churn.
- Additive-first: do not remove features/options unless explicitly requested.

## 3) UE plugin hygiene
- Don’t leave default auto-generated plugin template files mismatched (PCH/module wiring issues).
- If you modify any plugin: delete that plugin’s `Binaries/` and `Intermediate/` folders afterward.
- Do NOT run builds automatically.

## 4) Project shell rule
- Treat SOTS as plugin-only C++ (no project game module dependencies).
- Plugins must not depend on project-level CharacterBase/game module types; prefer components/interfaces/subsystems.
