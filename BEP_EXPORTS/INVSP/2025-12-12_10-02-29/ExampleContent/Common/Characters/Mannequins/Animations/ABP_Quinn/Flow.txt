    Node: This is a Child Anim BP (child of ABP_Manny). That means it uses the logic and graph of another Anim BP but can override sequence and blendspace players in the Asset Override Edditor window. Child AnimBPs are great if you have multiple characters with different animations but want to share logic. If you want to view or edit the Anim Graph and logic, open ABP_Manny.
