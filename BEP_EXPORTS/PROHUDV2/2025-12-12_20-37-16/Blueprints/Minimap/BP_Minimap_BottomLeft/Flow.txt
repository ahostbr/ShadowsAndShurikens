    Node: To calibrate the minimap, use this actor to define the area of the minimap. 

Place this actor in the lower left corner of your world in the area marked on the minimap. 

You can re-adjust this actor later at Runtime. Look out for the documentation -> Minimap calibration. (EdGraphNode_Comment)
