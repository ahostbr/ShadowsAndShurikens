# PowerShell Training Pack (SOTS House Style)

Purpose: reliable, repeatable PowerShell for SOTS automation. No “works once” scripts.

## How Buddy must use this pack
1) Read:
   - 01_HouseStyle.md
   - 05_CheatSheets/Idioms.md
2) Start new scripts from 02_Templates/ScriptTemplate.ps1
3) Reuse helpers from 03_Snippets/*
4) Before final answer, run 06_SelfCheck.md

## Golden rule
Plan → DryRun → Execute. Never delete/move/copy blindly.
