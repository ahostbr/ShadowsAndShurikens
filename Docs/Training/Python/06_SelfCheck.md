# Buddy Python Self‑Check

- [ ] pathlib.Path used everywhere
- [ ] No reliance on CWD (resolve paths)
- [ ] Inputs validated with clear errors
- [ ] Plan/DryRun for multi-step actions
- [ ] Atomic writes for any state/output files
- [ ] Subprocess captures stdout/stderr and checks exit codes
- [ ] Stable exit codes (0/1+)
- [ ] Tested mentally: spaces in paths, missing dirs, rerun safety
