# Buddy Unreal C++ Self‑Check

- [ ] No new dependency on project /Source module classes
- [ ] No Tick introduced unless justified
- [ ] Delegates/timers cleaned up (EndPlay/Deinitialize)
- [ ] Debug/editor code guarded (Shipping/Test safe)
- [ ] Settings validated + logs on missing config
- [ ] Minimal includes / forward declarations used
- [ ] Cross-plugin seams respected (no hidden coupling)
