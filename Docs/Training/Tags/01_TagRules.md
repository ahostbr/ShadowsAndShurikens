# Tag Rules (MANDATORY)

- DefaultGameplayTags.ini is ADD-ONLY (no renames/deletes without an explicit migration plan).
- Names must follow the existing root convention (SAS./SOTS. as used in the suite).
- Boundary tags (consumed by other plugins) must be owned and documented.
- Local tags (internal to a plugin) may bypass TagManager, but boundary tags must not.
- Any new tag must have at least one usage site + a short note on ownership/purpose.
