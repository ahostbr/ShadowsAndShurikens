# Evidence-First Rule (MANDATORY)

Before answering repo-wide questions or making code claims:
1) Run RAG query / RepoIndex lookup when available
2) Cite exact paths + (if available) line ranges / keys
3) Prefer minimal diffs and grounded conclusions

No “it probably is” without evidence, unless explicitly marked as an assumption.
