14.9 DEVTOOLS prompt naming (PLAN vs SPINE/BRIDGE/TOOLS/BUNDLE)
------------------------------------------------------------
14.9.1 Ryan will invoke plugin sweeps using prompts of the form:

    DEVTOOLS SOTS_*PLUGIN* PLAN
    DEVTOOLS SOTS_*PLUGIN* SPINE N
    DEVTOOLS SOTS_*PLUGIN* BRIDGE N
    DEVTOOLS SOTS_*PLUGIN* TOOLS N
    DEVTOOLS SOTS_*PLUGIN* BUNDLE N

where:
    - SOTS_*PLUGIN* is the target plugin (e.g. SOTS_TagManager, SOTS_INV).
    - PLAN / SPINE / BRIDGE / TOOLS / BUNDLE is the PassType.
    - N (if present) is just the ordinal pass number for that PassType
      within that plugin (1, 2, 3, …). It does NOT relate to “V2” or “V3”
      naming schemes.

14.9.2 When such a prompt is received, I must:
    - Treat the first token after DEVTOOLS as the plugin name.
    - Treat the next token as the PassType.
    - Treat any trailing integer as the pass index for that PassType only.
    - Never invent “V2”, “V3”, or “1–25” naming in the prompt itself.

14.10 PLAN supersede – code-state-based planning
------------------------------------------------------------
14.10.1 This law supersedes the earlier implication in 14.2 that a PLAN
        pass must map directly to a fixed “1–25” sequence (e.g. V2_1–25).
        Those older sequences remain useful DESIGN CODEX references, but
        they must not force a specific number of passes for a plugin.

14.10.2 When Ryan says:

    DEVTOOLS SOTS_*PLUGIN* PLAN

I must:
    - Inspect the actual current state of that plugin’s code from the
      current source of truth (GitHub repo or *LATEST.zip, per section 2).
    - Determine what is already solid vs what is missing or half-built:
        - Core types, subsystems, components, DataAssets, config.
        - Cross-plugin wiring (TagManager, GSM, ProfileShared, etc.).
        - Existing DevTools / QA scripts for that plugin.
    - Propose ONLY the number and types of passes (SPINE / BRIDGE / TOOLS /
      BUNDLE) that are genuinely needed to bring that plugin to a “finished
      and healthy” state.

14.10.3 PLAN output must:
    - Be a real, per-plugin roadmap grounded in code reality at that
      moment in time.
    - Use V2_1–25, V3_1–20, and similar sequences only as background design
      references when helpful.
    - Never assume “we always need 25 passes” or any fixed count just
      because earlier design docs used that shape.

14.10.4 Future SPINE / BRIDGE / TOOLS / BUNDLE passes for a plugin should
        normally follow the PLAN roadmap. If new discoveries during a pass
        show that more or fewer passes are needed, a new PLAN prompt for
        that plugin can update the roadmap.
