Troubleshooting Tampermonkey userscript issues

We need to troubleshoot the user's script problem. After updating the script, the full script should be provided, not just a snippet. There's a weird issue about the "Save Thoughts" button still acting like the "Send2SOTS" button. This could mean the script isn't updating properly, or there's an older version running, or an error in panel detection.

Refining detection for "Activity" panel

I need to adjust the detection to specifically identify the right-side "Activity" panel, ensuring it only picks up that container. This involves using bounding rect to check if it's on the right side of the screen. Plus, I'll add debug info that shows the element being used and offer an error message if the panel isn't found.
