# Buddy Worklog
- goal: explain how to connect to the MCP server from VS Code
- what changed: none (accounting/references only)
- files changed: none
- notes + risks/unknowns: instructions come from existing server docs and config; not verified by running the server
- verification status: UNVERIFIED (not run)
- follow-ups / next steps: run the configured MCP server command and confirm MCP clients can attach once the server prints its startup banner
